# Universal Prescription Management (UPM)
Universal Prescription Management is a proposed solution for organizing patients medical record and prescription. UPM will have a database,  encrypted storage, and RestFul API. Patients medical record will be encrypted with RSA. Pharmacy and Hospital Software can add and update records. Patients record can be shared using OPT system.
